# Mos Eisley Archives

This project is a full-stack web application built upon a Flask back-end operating alongside a PostgreSQL database, with a React-Redux front-end styled primarily with Material-UI.

## Premise:
Mos Eisley is a spaceport city on the Outer Rim planet of Tatooine, homeworld to protagonist Luke Skywalker. Famous in the film A New Hope for the initial meeting place between Luke and Han Solo (as well as other notable characters), the Mos Eisley Cantina was home to space-farers and scoundrels alike. 

This application aims to mimic a sort of digital forum and database for patrons to share messages about the happenings around the cantina, but also offers realistic usability to the user (that is, the real humans accessing this page, not just fictional) by allowing access to a database in order to store favorite Star Wars novels with various book details attached. Basic authentication and a fun side game with a local parts merchant make for an interactive and also functional hub with plenty of touches straight from the saga.


## Main purposes behind this project:
- Create a full-stack application utilizing both frameworks I have been introduced to thus far: Flask & React
- Dig deeper into the Material-UI API via React to design a unique & attractive UI
- More practice with setting up a Flask back-end, paired with a PostgreSQL database
- Create my first Star Wars appplication!


## I intend on introducing further functionality to this application in the future, including the following:
- Customizable user profiles, including connecting with other users & custom avatars
- Blog posts with additional functionality
- Option to upload images of books associated with archive entries
- Possible web scraping feature to display data from youtini.com or another available online resource to bolster content
